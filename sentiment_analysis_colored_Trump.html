<p class='positive'>While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.</p>
<p class='negative'>As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust.</p>
<p class='negative'>For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly incompatible.</p>
<p class='negative'>We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.</p>
<p class='negative'>It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.</p>
<p class='negative'>We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.</p>

<p class='negative'>We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class='negative'>And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.</p>
<p class='neutral'>All of this will change starting today.</p>
<p class='positive'>And it will change very quickly.</p>
<p class='negative'>My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom.</p>

<p class='positive'>It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.</p>

<p class='positive'>, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had.</p>
<p class='neutral'>for our rights and for our freedom.</p>
<p class='neutral'>They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.</p>
